A simple coin counter for python 2.7 using OpenCV.<br><br>
load image -> convert to grey scale -> apply gaussian blur -> apply canny edge detection -> find contours -> draw contours -> count the number of contours -> thus, count the number of coins.<br><br>
Replace "money.jpg" at the top of the program with your own coin images and have a play with some of the agument values.<br><br>
